## Insights Deep Dive

### 1️. Sales Trends Insights

- December 2023 contributed the highest share of total sales, accounting for 14.62% of the annual revenue ($371.17M), followed by November with 13.90%. In contrast, February was the lowest-performing month, contributing only 3.19%.

- In January, unit sales experienced a significant month-over-month (MoM) decline of -70.77% compared to December 2022. This drop is likely due to strong seasonal sales in December and typically low buyer activity in January.

- February saw a further MoM decline of -12.63% in unit sales compared to January. Historically, January and February have been the weakest months in both 2022 and 2023, reflecting a consistent seasonal dip following December's peak sales.

- From March to June, unit sales steadily increased, before experiencing a minor decline from June to September.

- The steepest increase in unit sales occurred in September, with a +104.47% MoM surge following a -12.68% MoM dip in August. This spike is likely due to seasonal promotions.

- In October, sales dropped sharply by -45.63% MoM (Units Sold) compared to September. This decline may reflect a pause in customer purchases as they awaited Black Friday or holiday season deals, which explains the strong rebound in November (+85.93% MoM) and a continued surge in December (+3.84% MoM).

## Recommendations & Strategic Actions

- **Phase Out Sebring Convertible**:Sales remain critically low with only a +1.86% year-over-year (YoY) increase, showing no significant improvement compared to 2022. It is advisable to consider phasing out this model due to consistently poor performance in both units sold and revenue.
- **Optimize Hardtop Sales During Peak Months**:Although Hardtop sales saw occasional spikes ( +304.77% MoM in October), overall contribution remains low at 13.85% of total sales. Re-strategize pricing, promotions, and inventory for Hardtop models, particularly during high-traffic months like September, to maximize returns.
- **Expand High-Performing Brands**: Consider expanding the model range for brands with strong sales performance, including Chevrolet, Volvo, BMW, and other top 9 revenue-generating companies. Introducing new or refreshed models under these brands can capitalize on existing brand momentum.
- **Boost Marketing in Weak Months**: Months like January and October, which historically underperform, require targeted marketing campaigns, limited-time offers, and customer incentives to stimulate demand during these slow periods.
- **Use Dynamic Pricing in Peak Months**: During peak sales months such as May, September, November, and December, consider dynamic pricing strategies, bundling, or value-added promotions to further boost revenue and capitalize on seasonal demand.

- **Improve Dealer Region Strategy**:Focus on for better returns.Re-evaluate pricing strategies and strengthen marketing efforts in underperforming dealer regions such as **Pasco** (+21.89% YoY) and **Middletown** (+20.21% YoY).
